This app was inspired by the work of Kathy Shrock: 
http://www.schrockguide.net/bloomin-apps.html

Mike Macfadden cobbled the code together:

One could easily make the argument that anyone of the apps on this
list COULD be placed on a different level of blooms taxonomy, and
they would probably be right. This is where I (Mike Macfadden) think 
they work best.

If you disagree, make your own graphic!!!
